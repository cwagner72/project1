# Disallow usage of window.alert (sap-no-window-alert)

A window.alert statement should not be part of the code that is committed to GIT!

Instead, sap.m.MessageBox should be used. Please check the [UI5 API](http://veui5infra.dhcp.wdf.sap.corp:8080/demokit/#docs/api/symbols/sap.m.MessageBox.html) reference for an example how to do it.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
window.alert('hello world');
```
